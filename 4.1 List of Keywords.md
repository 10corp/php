# PHP Keywords and VS Code Syntax Highlighting Configuration

This guide provides a complete list of PHP keywords, their purposes, and a VS Code configuration to customize their syntax highlighting using the Dracula dark theme. Tailored for a beginner with HTML/CSS experience learning PHP, Symfony, and Sulu CMS, this resource supports your 15-month study plan by enhancing code readability during PHP fundamentals (months 1–3). The configuration ensures PHP keywords stand out, aiding your daily 4-hour coding sessions and milestone projects like building a CRUD app.

## PHP Keywords

PHP keywords are reserved words that define the language’s syntax and functionality. They are case-insensitive and cannot be used as variable, function, or class names. Below is a categorized list of PHP keywords (as of PHP 8.3, relevant for 2025), grouped by their purpose, with brief explanations to help you understand their use in your CMS/CRM project.

### Control Structures

These keywords manage the flow of execution in PHP scripts, crucial for loops and conditionals in your early projects (e.g., guestbook in month 3).

*   `if` – Starts a conditional statement (e.g., `if ($x > 0)`).
*   `else` – Specifies an alternative block for an `if` condition.
*   `elseif` – Combines `else` and `if` for additional conditions.
*   `while` – Executes a block while a condition is true (e.g., `while ($i < 10)`).
*   `do` – Starts a do-while loop, executing at least once.
*   `for` – Defines a loop with initialization, condition, and increment (e.g., `for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++)`).
*   `foreach` – Iterates over arrays or objects (e.g., `foreach ($array as $value)`).
*   `break` – Exits a loop or switch statement.
*   `continue` – Skips the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next.
*   `switch` – Starts a switch statement for multiple conditions.
*   `case` – Defines a condition within a `switch` block.
*   `default` – Specifies the default case in a `switch` block.

### Function and Class Definitions

These keywords are used to define functions and classes, essential for OOP in months 2–3 and Symfony/Sulu CMS development (months 4–8).

*   `function` – Declares a function (e.g., `function add($a, $b)`).
*   `return` – Returns a value from a function.
*   `class` – Defines a class (e.g., `class User`).
*   `interface` – Declares an interface for classes to implement.
*   `trait` – Defines reusable methods for classes (e.g., `trait Loggable`).
*   `extends` – Indicates a class inherits from another (e.g., `class Child extends Parent`).
*   `implements` – Specifies interfaces a class implements.
*   `abstract` – Declares an abstract class or method.
*   `final` – Prevents a class or method from being extended or overridden.
*   `public` – Sets a property or method as publicly accessible.
*   `protected` – Restricts access to a property or method to the class and its subclasses.
*   `private` – Restricts access to a property or method to the class only.
*   `static` – Declares a property or method as class-level, not instance-level.

### Namespace and Scope

These keywords manage code organization, critical for modern PHP practices with Composer (month 2) and Symfony (months 4–10).

*   `namespace` – Declares a namespace to organize code (e.g., `namespace App\Controller`).
*   `use` – Imports classes, functions, or constants from another namespace.
*   `global` – Accesses a global variable within a function.
*   `const` – Defines a constant (e.g., `const MAX_USERS = 100`).

### Exception Handling

These keywords handle errors, useful for robust applications like your CRM module (months 11–12).

*   `try` – Starts a block to attempt potentially error-prone code.
*   `catch` – Handles exceptions thrown in a `try` block.
*   `finally` – Executes code after `try`/`catch`, regardless of outcome.
*   `throw` – Throws an exception (e.g., `throw new Exception("Error")`).

### Variable Handling

These keywords manage variables and references, relevant for PHP basics (month 1).

*   `var` – Declares a class property (deprecated in favor of `public`).
*   `isset` – Checks if a variable is set and not null.
*   `unset` – Destroys a variable.
*   `empty` – Checks if a variable is empty.

### Logical and Inclusion

These keywords handle logic and file inclusion, used in your CRUD app and Sulu CMS setup (months 3–6).

*   `and` – Logical AND operator (alternative to `&&`).
*   `or` – Logical OR operator (alternative to `||`).
*   `xor` – Logical XOR operator.
*   `include` – Includes and evaluates a file (e.g., `include 'config.php'`).
*   `include_once` – Includes a file only once.
*   `require` – Includes a file, halting on failure.
*   `require_once` – Includes a file only once, halting on failure.

### Miscellaneous

These keywords serve various purposes, encountered across your study plan.

*   `echo` – Outputs a string (e.g., `echo "Hello"`).
*   `print` – Outputs a string with a return value.
*   `die` – Outputs a message and exits (alias for `exit`).
*   `exit` – Terminates script execution.
*   `eval` – Executes a string as PHP code (use cautiously).
*   `goto` – Jumps to a labeled section (avoid in modern PHP).
*   `yield` – Returns a value from a generator function.
*   `new` – Creates a new object instance (e.g., `new User()`).
*   `clone` – Creates a copy of an object.
*   `instanceof` – Checks if an object is an instance of a class.
*   `__halt_compiler` – Stops the compiler, used in specific contexts.

### Type Declarations (PHP 7+)

These keywords define types, relevant for Symfony 7 (months 9–10) and modern PHP.

*   `int` – Integer type (e.g., `function add(int $a)`).
*   `float` – Floating-point type.
*   `bool` – Boolean type.
*   `string` – String type.
*   `array` – Array type.
*   `object` – Object type.
*   `callable` – Callable type.
*   `iterable` – Iterable type.
*   `void` – No return value.
*   `mixed` – Any type (PHP 8.0+).
*   `never` – Function never returns (PHP 8.1+).
*   `true` – Boolean true value.
*   `false` – Boolean false value.
*   `null` – Null value.

## VS Code Syntax Highlighting for PHP Keywords

To make PHP keywords stand out in your code, customize the Dracula dark theme in VS Code, as it’s beginner-friendly and supports PHP/Twig for your Sulu CMS projects. The following configuration highlights PHP keywords in a distinct color, improving readability for your milestone projects (e.g., guestbook in month 3, Sulu site in month 8).

    *   Install “PHP Intelephense” for autocompletion and diagnostics.
    *   Install “Twig Language” for Sulu CMS templating.
    *   Install “PHP Debug” for debugging support.

### Customization

Customize PHP keyword highlighting in `settings.json` to make keywords like `if`, `function`, and `class` more visible. This configuration uses a bright pink color (#FF79C6) for keywords, contrasting with Dracula’s dark background (#282a36).

1.  **Open settings.json**:
    *   Go to `File > Preferences > Settings`.
    *   Click the `{}` icon (top-right) to open `settings.json`.
2.  **Add Customization**:
    
    ```css
    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
      "textMateRules": [
        {
          "scope": "keyword.control.php", // Control structures (if, while, for, etc.)
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#FF79C6" // Bright pink
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "keyword.other.php", // Function, class, namespace, etc.
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#FF79C6" // Bright pink
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "keyword.operator.php", // Logical operators (and, or, xor)
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#FF79C6" // Bright pink
          }
        },
        {
          "scope": "punctuation.section.embedded.begin.php, punctuation.section.embedded.end.php", // PHP tags
          "settings": {
            "foreground": "#FF5555" // Bright red for <?php and ?>
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,
    "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
    "editor.renderLineHighlight": "all"
    ```
    
3.  **Save and Test**:
    *   Save `settings.json`.
    *   Open a PHP file (e.g., `index.php`) to verify that keywords like `if`, `function`, and `class` appear in bright pink, and PHP tags in red.

### Example PHP Code with Highlighting

With the above configuration, the following code will have highlighted keywords:

```php
<?php // Red tags
namespace App; // Pink namespace

use App\User; // Pink use

class User { // Pink class
    public function greet(string $name): string { // Pink public, function
        if ($name) { // Pink if
            return "Hello, $name!"; // Pink return
        } else { // Pink else
            throw new Exception("No name provided"); // Pink throw
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Keywords** (`namespace`, `use`, `class`, `public`, `function`, `if`, `else`, `return`, `throw`) are bright pink (#FF79C6).
*   **PHP Tags** (`<?php`, `?>`) are bright red (#FF5555).
*   **Fira Code** font with ligatures enhances readability.
